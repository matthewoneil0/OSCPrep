# OSCPrep
All tools, scripts, and forks of everything I've used to study and prepare for my OSCP. Below are the tools contained in this repository. I've also included a number of HackTheBox machine walkthroughs I completed in preparation for the exam, all of which were selected from this [list][(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dwSMIAPIam0PuRBkCiDI88pU3yzrqqHkDtBngUHNCw8/edit?usp=sharing) of OSCP-like machines.
